				Absolutely! Your photos never leave your device. All editing happens directly in your
				browser using JavaScript and Canvas technology. We don't upload, store, or have access to
				any of your images. This makes PhotoLab 100% private and secure.

				Since editing happens in your browser, the limit depends on your device's memory. Most
				modern devices can easily handle images up to 50MB. For very large files, you may experience
				slower processing times, but the editing quality remains excellent.

				While individual undo steps aren't available, you can always start fresh with the reset
				button. Your original file remains untouched, so you can re-upload anytime.
